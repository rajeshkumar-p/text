1. Predict the output of following program.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A
{
protected:
    int x;
public:
    A() {x = 0;}
    friend void show();
};
 
class B: public A
{
public:
    B() : y (0) {}
private:
    int y;
};
 
void show()
{
    A a;
    B b;
    cout << "The default value of A::x = " << a.x << " ";
    cout << "The default value of B::y = " << b.y;
}

A Compiler Error in show() because x is protected in class A
B Compiler Error in show() because y is private in class b
C The default value of A::x = 0 The default value of B::y = 0
D Compiler Dependent

Answer: B

Explanation: 
Please note that show() is a friend of class A, so there should not be any compiler error in accessing any member of A in show(). Class B is inherited from A, the important point to note here is friendship is not inherited. So show() doesn't become a friend of B and therefore can't access private members of B.

2. Predict the output the of following program.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class B;
class A {
    int a;
public:
    A():a(0) { }
    void show(A& x, B& y);
};
 
class B {
private:
    int b;
public:
    B():b(0) { }
    friend void A::show(A& x, B& y);
};
 
void A::show(A& x, B& y) {
    x.a = 10;
    cout << "A::a=" << x.a << " B::b=" << y.b;
}
 
int main() {
    A a;
    B b;
    a.show(a,b);
    return 0;
}

A Compiler Error
B A::a=10 B::b=0
C A::a=0 B::b=0

Answer: B

Explanation: 
This is simple program where a function of class A is declared as friend of class B. Since show() is friend, it can access private data members of B.

3. If a function is friend of a class, which one of the following is wrong?
A A function can only be declared a friend by a class itself.
B Friend functions are not members of a class, they are associated with it.
C Friend functions are members of a class.
D It can have access to all members of the class, even private ones.

Answer: Explanation: 
Friend of the class can be member of some other class but Friend functions are not the members of a particular class. Option (C) is correct.

4. Which one of the following is correct, when a class grants friend status to another class?
A The member functions of the class generating friendship can access the members of the friend class.
B All member functions of the class granted friendship have unrestricted access to the members of the class granting the friendship.
C Class friendship is reciprocal to each other.
D There is no such concept.

Answer: B

Explanation: 
When a class grants friend status to another class then all member functions of the class granted friendship have unrestricted access to the members of the class granting the friendship.
The member functions of the class generating friendship can access the members of the friend class.Incorrect statement.
Class friendship is not reciprocal to each other.
