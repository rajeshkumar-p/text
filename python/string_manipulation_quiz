What is the output of the following program?
line = "I'll come by then."
eline = "" 
for i in line: 
    eline += chr(ord(i)+3) 
print(eline)     

a) L*oo frph e| wkhq1
b) L*oo#frph#e|#wkhq1
c) l*oo@frph@e|$wkhq1
d) O*oo#Frph#E|#wKhq1

Ans. (b)
Explanation: This piece of code ciphers the plain text. Each character is moved
to its 3rd next character by increasing the ascii value. ‘I’ becomes ‘L’, thus
option (c) and (d) are ruled out. ‘ ‘ has ascii value of 32, thus it’ll become
35(‘#’), thus option (a) is ruled out as, ‘ ‘ can not remain to be ‘ ‘ in the
ciphered text.

5) What is the output of the following program?
line =  "What will have so will"
L = line.split('a') 
for i in L: 
    print(i, end=' ') 

a) [‘What’, ‘will’, ‘have’, ‘so’, ‘will’]
b) Wh t will h ve so will
c) What will have so will
d) [‘Wh’, ‘t will h’, ‘ve so will’]

Ans. (b)
Explanation: split() will use ‘a’ as the delimiter. It’ll create parition at
‘a’, thus split() return an array L, which is in [‘Wh’, ‘t will h’, ‘ve so
will’]. For loop will print the elements of the list.
