    1) What is the output of the following program?
    x = ['ab', 'cd'] 
    for i in x: 
        i.upper() 
    print(x) 

    Output:
    ['ab', 'cd']

    Explanation:
    The function upper() does not modify a string in place, but it returns a new
string which here isn’t being stored anywhere. So we will get our original list
as output.

    2) What is the output of the following program?
    x = ['ab', 'cd'] 
    for i in x: 
        x.append(i.upper()) 
    print(x) 

    Output:
    No Output

    Explanation:
    The loop does not terminate as new elements are being added to the list in
each iteration. So our program will stuck in infinite loop

    3) What is the output of the following program?
    i = 1
    while True: 
        if i%3 == 0: 
            break
        print(i) 
        i + = 1

    Output:

    No Output

    Explanation:
    The program will give no output as there is an error in the code. In python
while using expression there shouldn’t be a space between + and = in +=.

    4) What is the output of the following program?
    x = 123
    for i in x: 
        print(i) 

    Output:
    Error!

    Explanation:
    Objects of type int are not iterable instead a list, dictionary or a tuple
should be used.

    5) What is the output of the following program?
    for i in [1, 2, 3, 4][::-1]: 
        print (i) 

    Output:
    4
    3
    2
    1

    Explanation:
    Adding [::-1] beside your list reverses the list. So output will be the
elements of original list but in reverse order.


5. What is the output of the following?
i = 1
while True: 
    if i % 3 == 0: 
        break
    print(i) 
    i + = 1

    1 2 3.
    1 2.
    Syntax Error.
    None of these

Output:
3. Syntax Error
Explanation: SyntaxError, there shouldn’t be a space between + and = in +=.

Program 2:
for i in  range(2): 
    print i 
  
for i in range(4,6): 
    print i 

Output:
0
1
4
5

Explanation: If only single argument is passed to the range method, Python
considers this argument as the end of the range and the default start value of
range is 0. So, it will print all the numbers starting from 0 and before the
supplied argument.
For the second for loop the starting value is explicitly supplied as 4 and
ending is 5.
