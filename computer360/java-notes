Neelam Agarwal Basic Core Java

- JDK & JVM
- Java properties
- primitive data type, local variable, instance variable, class variable
- different memory area in JAVA
- design principle : loose coupling and high cohesion
- reference variable
- private constructor & static object generation function - loose coupling
- singleton class/singleton pattern
- how/way to delete a singleton object ?

Major JVM components
- Class Loader
- Bytecode Verifier
- Execution Engine - Interpretor, JIT
- Garbage Collector - Lower priority, invoked only when program needs more
  memory

JIT - frequently called code, would be compiled and cached and used whenever
needed, main piece of code is still interpreted, used to overcome slowness of
JAVA due to interpretation


Polymorphism - function overloading & function overriding
Inheritence - is-a 
- regular employee is a employee
- apple is fruit
- car is a vehicle

Composition/Aggregation - has-a
- car has a engine
- company has a employee
- department has a student

3 associations - is-a, has-a, use

3 types of inheritence 
- single (single parent) 
- multiple inheritence (multiple parent)
- multilevel inheritence (single parent)
- in broader term, it is of two types only, single & multiple inheritence
  based on number of parents
- properties of parents will be shared by its descendants
- java doesnt support multiple inheritence, directly, but to someextend can
  achieve through interfaces

Explain Inheritence and composition using
- Bank Account - SA, DA, RD, FD
- Customer
