OSPF Fundamentals
=================

- Link state rouing protocol
- Shortest Path First (SPF) Algorithm
- Triggered updates : updates are triggered only if there is a change in learned
  routing table

Note : In distance vector routing protocols (RIP) routing entries are exchanged
at a period of time

- Network Layer Protocol - Protocol Number 89
- Uses 224.0.0.5 for normal communication
       224.0.0.6 for update to designate router(DR)/Backup designate router(BDR)

OSPF Terms
==========

Router Id : Highest active IP address present on the router
   - First highesh loopback address is considered
   - If no loop back address configured, highest active IP address on the
     interface of the router is considered

Router Priority : 8 Bit value assigned to router operating OSFP
   - Higher the value, higher the priority
   - Used to elect DR and BDR in a network  

Designated Router(DR) : 
   - Elected to minimize no of adjaceny formig
   - DR distributes LSA's to all other routers
   - DR is elected in a broadcast network, to which all other routers share
     their DBD
   - In a broadcast network, router requests update to DR and DR will respond
     to the request

Backup Designated Router(BDR) :
   - Backup to DR
   - When DR goes down, BDR becomes DR and performs its functions
 

DR and BDR election criteria :
   - Router having the highest priority will be declared as DR
   - If there is a tie in the router priority, then router Id will be considered
   - How BDR selected ?

OSPF Messages
=============

Hello Message :
   - Keep alive messages used for neighbor discovery/recovery
   - Exchanged in every 10 seconds (configurable ? )
   - Hello message information includes
        - Router Id
        - Hello/dead Interval
        - Area I'd
        - Router Priority
        - DR and BDR IP Address
        - Authentication Data

DBD (Database Description) :
   - OSPF routes of the router
   - Contains topology of an AS

Link state request (LSR)
   - When router receives DBD, it compares it with own DBD
   - If the DBD has more information than its own DBD, then it send LSR request
     to neighbor

Link state update (LSU)
   - When router receives LSR, it responds with LSU message containing details
     requested

Link state acknowledgement
   - Provides reliability to the link state exchange
   - Sent as acknowledgement for receiving LSU

Link state advertisement (LSA)
   - OSPF data packet that contains link state routing information
   - Shared only with routers to which adjaceny has formed
