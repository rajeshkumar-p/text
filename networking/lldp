LLDP - Link Layer Discovery Protocol
====================================

- formally referred to by the IEEE as Station and Media Access Control
  Connectivity Discovery specified in IEEE 802.1AB

- used by network devices for advertising their identity, capabilities, and
  neighbors on a local area network

- Information gathered with LLDP can be stored in the device management
  information database (MIB) and queried with the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) as specified in RFC 2922 (Physical topology MIB)

- Information that may be retrieved include:
    System name and description
    Port name and description
    VLAN name
    IP management address
    System capabilities (switching, routing, etc.)
    MAC/PHY information
    MDI power
    Link aggregation

- LLDP's frame details
    Dest MAC : 01:80:c2:00:00:0e / 
               01:80:c2:00:00:03 / 
               01:80:c2:00:00:00
    LLDP ethertype : 0x88CC

    LLDPDU is a sequence of type-length-value (TLV) structures.
    TLV structure : 7 bit Type | 9 bit Length | 0 - 511 Octets value
    Mandatory TLVs: Chassis ID (1), 
                    Port ID (2), 
                    Time-to-Live (3) and 
                    End of LLDPDU (0).
    Optional TLVs : Port description (4), 
                    System Name (5), 
                    System description(6), 
                    System capabilities (7), 
                    Management address (8)
    Reserved TLVs : 9 - 126
    Custom TLVs   : 127
    Custom TLV starts with a 24-bit organizationally unique identifier and a 
1 byte organizationally specific subtype followed by data
